Please read the csv file and use Matplotlib to create the graph.

There are four graphs: 

(1) the Line chart of male, female, and total population in each township

(2) the Line chart of immigration and emigration

(3) the Bar chart of household number

(4) the Line chart of births and deaths

Your chart must include the following requirements:

(1) The subplot was used to combine the four maps into a 2*2 map with the figure size of (16, 16) and the title is Miaoli County population data.

(2) Each subplot must have a subtitle.

(3) The horizontal axis is the administrative area, and the vertical axis is the numerical data, and the scale of each figure is not limited.

(4) The style of different data (e.g., male and female and total) in the line graph should be different, and please attach the legend.

(5) Save the generated graphs and upload them.

The attached file above is the passenger list of the Titanic. It records the passengers' names, deck level, gender, age (some data missing), and survival status.

Please use the KNN classification method, with 30% of the data as test data. Find the most suitable features for prediction and the optimal K value, and achieve the best predictive accuracy on the test data.

The file you submit should include the code, and a brief report detailing the features used, the target of the prediction, the K value, and the prediction results. The report should describe the process of your adjustments, observations, and reasons for finally choosing the said features and K value. Please submit the report in .ipynb, .docx, or .pdf format.
